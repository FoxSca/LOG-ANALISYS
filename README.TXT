 Log Monitoring and Alert Script

Purpose:
The script is designed to monitor a specific log file for suspicious activities and automatically send alerts via Telegram when such activities are detected. It leverages the watchdog library to watch for changes in the log file and performs heuristic analysis to identify potential security threats.

Components and Functionality:

    Logging Setup:
        Configures logging to track script operations and errors.
        Logs are output with timestamps and messages to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

    Telegram Configuration:
        Uses the telegram library to set up a bot for sending notifications.
        The bot token and chat ID are used to send messages to a specific Telegram chat when suspicious activities are detected.

    File Monitoring:
        Utilizes the watchdog library to observe changes in the specified log file.
        Monitors the log file for any modifications and reads new entries that are appended to the file.

    Log File Handler:
        LogFileHandler is a custom event handler that extends FileSystemEventHandler from the watchdog library.
        The on_modified method is triggered when the log file is updated. It reads new log entries and analyzes them for suspicious activities.

    Heuristic Attack Detection:
        The script implements several heuristic methods to identify potential attacks:
            Failed Login Attempts: Detects repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address. If the threshold of failed attempts is exceeded, it triggers an alert.
            Suspicious Activity: Identifies general suspicious activities based on predefined patterns in the log entries.
            Unusual Access Times: Flags entries that indicate access at unusual times.
            Directory Traversal Attacks: Detects patterns associated with directory traversal attacks.
            Lateral Movement Attacks: Identifies patterns related to lateral movement within a network.
            File Upload Patterns: Detects log entries indicating file uploads.

    Alert Notification:
        When a heuristic attack is detected, the script extracts the IP address (if available) and sends a detailed alert message via Telegram.
        The alert includes the detected activity and the relevant log entry for further investigation.

    Error Handling:
        Handles potential errors when reading the log file or sending Telegram messages, logging them for troubleshooting.

    Execution:
        The script starts by setting the path to the log file and initializing the LogFileHandler.
        It then starts the Observer to monitor the log file for changes.
        The script runs indefinitely, continuously monitoring the file and sending alerts as necessary.
        The observer can be stopped gracefully using a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C), after which it joins the thread to clean up resources.

Usage:

    Replace 'your_telegram_bot_token' and 'your_chat_id' with actual values for the Telegram bot token and chat ID.
    Set the path to the log file in log_file_path.
    Ensure the necessary libraries (watchdog, telegram, etc.) are installed and available in your environment.

Security Considerations:

    Ensure that sensitive information such as Telegram bot tokens is kept secure and not hard-coded in the script for production use.
    Validate and sanitize log entries and patterns to avoid false positives and ensure accurate detection.
