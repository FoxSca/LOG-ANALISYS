This script monitors a specified log file in real-time, analyzes log entries for heuristic attack patterns, and sends alerts to a Telegram bot. It uses the watchdog library to detect changes in the log file and the python-telegram-bot library to send messages to Telegram.
Prerequisites

    Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Telegram Bot: Create a Telegram bot by talking to BotFather on Telegram and obtain the bot token. Also, get your chat ID by sending a message to your bot or using a tool like IDBot.
    Dependencies: Install the required Python packages using pip:

    bash

pip install python-telegram-bot watchdog

Script Components

    Imports and Logging:
        Import necessary libraries.
        Set up logging for monitoring script activity.

    Telegram Bot Configuration:
        Configure the Telegram bot with your bot token and chat ID.
        send_telegram_message function sends a message to your specified Telegram chat.

    Log File Handler:
        LogFileHandler class monitors changes to the log file.
        on_modified method checks for new log entries when the file is modified.
        analyze_log method analyzes new log entries for heuristic attack patterns.
        is_heuristic_attack method contains heuristic detection logic (e.g., detecting repeated failed login attempts).
        extract_ip method extracts IP addresses from log entries using a regular expression.

    Observer Setup:
        Initialize and start the observer to watch the specified log file directory.
        Continuously monitor the log file and handle keyboard interruption gracefully.

Usage

    Save the Script:
    Save the script to a file, e.g., log_monitor.py.

    Edit the Script:
        Replace 'your_telegram_bot_token' with your actual Telegram bot token.
        Replace 'your_chat_id' with your actual Telegram chat ID.
        Replace 'path_to_your_log_file.log' with the actual path to the log file you want to monitor.

    Run the Script:
    Execute the script using Python:

    bash

    python log_monitor.py

Customization

    Heuristic Detection:
        Modify the is_heuristic_attack method to add more sophisticated detection patterns based on your log file format and specific attack signatures.
        Adjust the threshold for failed login attempts or add more checks for different types of suspicious activities.

    Logging:
        Enhance logging to provide more detailed insights into the detection process and script performance.
