Description and Usage Guide
Overview

This script is designed to monitor a log file for suspicious activities and send alerts via multiple channels, including Telegram, MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform), Elasticsearch, and OpenCTI (Open Cyber Threat Intelligence). The script is particularly useful for cybersecurity professionals who want to keep track of potential threats and respond promptly.
Features

    Log Monitoring: Continuously monitors a specified log file for changes.
    Heuristic Analysis: Identifies potential security threats based on predefined heuristic patterns.
    Multi-Channel Alerting: Sends alerts through Telegram, MISP, Elasticsearch, and OpenCTI.
    Customizable Detection: Uses pattern files for detecting directory traversal, lateral movement, and file uploads.

Pattern Files

The script uses pattern files to detect specific types of suspicious activities. These files should be placed in the same directory as the script.
1. traversal_patterns.txt

Contains patterns to detect directory traversal attacks. Examples include:

    ../
    ..\\
    %2e%2e%2f

2. lateral_patterns.txt

Contains patterns to detect lateral movement activities within a network. Examples include:

    remote desktop protocol (rdp)
    smb
    ps exec

3. upload_patterns.txt

Contains patterns to detect file upload activities. Examples include:

    file uploaded
    upload complete
    uploaded successfully

Configuration

    Configuration File (config.ini):
        Telegram: TOKEN and CHAT_ID
        MISP: URL, API_KEY, and VERIFY_SSL
        Elasticsearch: HOST, PORT, and INDEX_NAME
        OpenCTI: URL and API_KEY

    Install Required Libraries:
    Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
        watchdog
        python-telegram-bot
        requests
        elasticsearch
        configparser

Usage

    Prepare Configuration:
        Edit config.ini with your service credentials and settings.

    Prepare Pattern Files:
        Create traversal_patterns.txt, lateral_patterns.txt, and upload_patterns.txt with the respective patterns.

    Run the Script:
    Use the command line to run the script. Example:

    bash

    python monitor_logs.py path_to_your_log_file.log --destinations telegram misp elasticsearch opencti

        path_to_your_log_file.log: Path to the log file you want to monitor.
        --destinations: Specify the destinations where alerts should be sent (options: telegram, misp, elasticsearch, opencti).

    Monitor Alerts:
        Telegram: Alerts will be sent as messages to your specified chat.
        MISP: Alerts will be sent as events in MISP.
        Elasticsearch: Alerts will be indexed in Elasticsearch.
        OpenCTI: Alerts will be sent as indicators in OpenCTI.

Important Notes

    Ensure you have appropriate permissions and credentials for the services you are integrating with.
    Regularly update your pattern files to reflect new threat intelligence.
    Adjust heuristic detection logic as needed to fit your specific environment and requirements.
